# Prospecting and Planning

This is where the user can come and plan for the future. Transactions listed here are read-only
and just display the transactions otherwise updated in the budgets or the account detail pages.

## Income Transactions & Totals

I couldn't make up my mind if I wanted just a sample or all transactions to be listed here.
The idea was to get a glimpse of the transactions that were tagged under the "income" tags
as described by the settings. The user would be able to see the list of transactions in the
mini-window. There would also be a total based on the transactions included in the tagging.

In this way, the user would be able to see inflows of funding.

## Expense Transactions & Totals

In the expense section, the same deal as the income transactions, but for the "expense" tags
as listed by the user settings. Multiple transactions could be flagged as such but would only
be counted once.

In this way, the user could get a clear glimpse of how expenses are flowing out.

Between these two views, the user should be able to see if they are upside down on their spend.

## Projected Balances

This section would detail what projected balances will be by end of month based on current records
for this month.

## Wishlist Items

I probably should pick another name that better describes this, but the idea is to insert mock
transactions that haven't happened yet to simluate what this would do to your balances by end
of month.

In this way, you could add incoming/expected payments, known bills and wishlist items you want
to purchase to see how they would impact finances for the month.

This is where Yaba is different from other budgeting apps because it doesn't take much math to
see if you are spending above or below your means once you have your data loaded into the app.
