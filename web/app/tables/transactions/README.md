# Transaction Table

This parent component is responsible for bringing together the entire operations of the `<yaba-transactions-list>` and
`<yaba-transactions-sample>` components.

This represents a transaction table. Filters can be included with the list component. Filters and operations are omitted
with the sample component.

The sample component only includes enough to render the table and limits to the top 5 transactions it receives.

The list component is the fully featured component with filters, bulk operations and events for all changes within this component..
