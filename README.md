# Premise
I am tired of tracking my finances across so many apps, platforms, logging into
many banks and other accounts to see my net worth.

I am building this to be a data aggregator that will go fetch all the data for
you and render it in a single pane of glass that lets you see your finances all
in one place in an easy-to-update setup. This will allow you to categorize and
tag transactions to include them in buckets where you can perform your budgeting
and have full visibility of your finances, where money is going and where your
spending is being spent.
