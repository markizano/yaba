# Premise
I am tired of tracking my finances being across so many apps, platforms, logging into
many banks and other accounts to track my net worth.

I am building this to be a data aggregator for all my finances. It will be manual at first
but I can always build it to be more automated once I get the structure of what I want laid out.

There are some problems I am facing when it comes to budgeting ... why not go with someone else?
- The market is shifting and changing all the time. You never know when your favorite budgeting
  app will be the next Mint.com.
- Banks go offline, get eaten by other banks or life events happen or you find another great offer
  you can't pass up.
- You're like me and want to control your own ledger and see where your accounts are sitting at 
  based on the statements and documents you obtain from the bank itself.

This is an interface that will live as long as I do because I will support it through my
endeavors.

Core features include:
- Budgeting: Allows for custom tagging of transactions in a seamless fashion where changes are
  saved right there as you update the table.
- Charts and Graphs to help visualize your bugets and spend.
- Drag and Drop features where you can drag and drop your CSV files from your bank into the app
  for easy imports.
- Easy tracking of all your transactions across accounts.

The idea behind this app is you download your copy of the software, download the CSV files from
your banks, unplug the ethernet cable, and have a nice day budgeting!

There's no tracking software, no logins or passwords, no server to talk to, just you and your data
and it's open-source so you can inspect it yourself!
