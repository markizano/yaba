# Diagram Documentation

For the `.dia` files in this directory, you can use [Dia](http://dia-installer.de/) to preview the architecture cards.

Dia supports exporting to PNG so you can view the image version of it as well. For size purposes, I don't commit the images to source control.
The Diagram files are portable enough to get the idea across without bloating the repository since Git does not handle binaries very well.
